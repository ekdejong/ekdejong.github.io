I have recently resumed engineering and improvements to [Cloudy.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Cloudy.jl) alongside Dr. Sajjad Azimi after my initial contributions related to a [JAMES publication](http://ekdejong.github.io/files/2022-cloudy.pdf). My current work focuses on a computational technique to avoid the instabilities of inverting the moments of a multi-modal distribution.
