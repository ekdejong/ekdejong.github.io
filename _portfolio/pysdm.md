I am an active developer of [PySDM](https://github.com/open-atmos/PySDM), a Pythonic implementation of the superdroplet method for cloud microphysics. My recent contributions include supervision of an undergraduate student project to add a "memory" of instantaneous droplet velocity, as well as the addition of a [new collisional breakup dynamic]('http://ekdejong.github.io/files/2023-breakup.pdf') and corresponding [examples](http://ekdejong.github.io/files/2023-joss.pdf).
